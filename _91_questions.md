# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)## 10.1 About MATLAB mex set up### 10.1.1 Where do I install a TDM-gcc compiler?This is a general question for all MATLAB users to apply mex C/C++ compilers where more detailscan be found online, such as [7, 8]. Users need to install suitable mex C/C++ compilers basedon their OS and MATLAB versions. In my experience, the mex C/C++ compiler usually is alreadyinstalled on MAC system. For Windows users, I usually install the TDM-gcc compiler on a first levelmain disk, such as “C:, D:, E:”, and higher level disks (like “C/FirstLevel/SecondLevel/...”) may notwork. If you have better suggestions, I appreciate you could let me know.### 10.1.2 Mex permission deniedMATLAB command window reports an error message when mex permission is denied, see Fig. 15.This error appears because a mex has already been set. To fix this bug, please update the firstcode section mex -O ba_interp2.cpp; to try mex -O ba_interp2.cpp; catch; end .<p align="center">  <img width="538" src="C:\Users\yehju\Documents\Research_Doxygen\images\fig_err_mex_permission.png"></p>Figure 15: MATLAB command window reports an error message when mex permission is denied.### 10.1.3 File “ba interp2.cpp” is not foundMATLAB command window reports an error message when the “ba interp2.cpp” file is not found,see Fig. 16. This error happens because “ba interp2.cpp” file does not exist in MATLAB “Current Folder”. To fix this bug, please enter the “2D FE Global DIC v∗” folder and then re-run the“main FE Global DIC.m” code Section 1. Alternatively, the user could also copy and paste a“ba interp2.cpp” file to your current folder.<p align="center">  <img width="538" src="C:\Users\yehju\Documents\Research_Doxygen\images\fig_err_mex_cpp_notfound.png"></p>Figure 16: MATLAB command window reports an error message when the “ba interp2.cpp” file can not be found.## 10.2 About the algorithm### 10.2.1 MATLAB reports error “Undefined function or variable”Please make sure you have already added all the subfolders (’./src’,’./plotfiles’, ...) and the DICimage folder on the MATLAB path.### 10.2.2 Which image to load as the first image?One comment about this finite element based global code is that it is set by default to manipulatethe deformed images and attempt to transform deformed images back to the reference image andcompute their deformation fields, which is based on the Lagrangian description. If the user wantsto track the deformation field in the Eulerian description, he/she can select the reference image asthe second image, and select the deformed image as the first image and manipulate the referenceimage to transform to the current deformed image.### 10.2.3 How to compute other types of strains?(i) What the finite element based global DIC code solved are displacements (U = x(X) − X) anddeformation gradients (F = ∇XU = ∇Xx−I), where x and X are the coordinates in deformed and reference configurations, respectively. U is stored in ResultDisp , and F is stored in ResultDefGrad.In this FE-based global DIC, length of the displacement vector – U – is two times of the row numberof the FE-mesh coordinates (ResultFEMesh{1}.coordinatesFEM), and U vector is assembled bythe nodal displacements [u1, v1, u2, v2, · · · , uN, vN]T with nodal indices as [1, 2, · · · , N]. The lengthof F vector is four times of the row number of FE-mesh coordinates and is assembled in the orderof [F111, F121, F112, F122, F211, F221, F212, F222, · · · , FN11, FN21, FN12, FN22]T.(ii) With the FE-based global DIC solved displacements U and deformation gradients F, we calculate strains in code Section 5. For example, if strains are small (< 5%), infinitesimal strain isa good option, where exx = F11, eyy = F22, exy = 0.5 (F12 + F21). For engineering shear strains,Exx = F11, Eyy = F22, Exy = (F12 + F21). With computed F or FStraintemp , other types of finitestrain measurements can be easily computed based on user’s choice.(iii) Comment about difference between F and FStraintemp . In code Section 5, you will be alsobe asked:1 What method to use to compute strain ?2 0: Finite element ( Recommended ) ;3 1: Finite difference ;4 2: Plane fitting ;If you choose the method 0, FStraintemp is computed from the Gauss points of the finite elements; If you choose the method 1 or method 2, the FStraintemp is re-computed from thecomputed u. The size of FStraintemp is cropped by Rad , since the strains near the edges areless accurate. The coordinates of FStraintemp are:x0(1+Rad:M-Rad,1+Rad:N-Rad), y0(1+Rad:M-Rad,1+Rad:N-Rad) .
